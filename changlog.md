## Summary

I have successfully created a comprehensive organizations management page with the following features:

### ✅ Organizations Page (/app/pages/organizations.vue)

• Nuxt UI Table: Displays all organizations with columns for name, members, and creation date
• Responsive Design: Uses UDashboardPanel for consistent layout with other pages
• Loading States: Shows loading indicator while fetching organizations
• Empty State: Helpful message when no organizations exist

### ✅ Create Organization Modal

• Form Fields: Name, slug, logo URL, and metadata (JSON)
• Auto-slug Generation: Automatically generates slug from organization name
• Slug Validation: Real-time checking for slug availability using Better Auth
• Form Validation: Ensures required fields are filled
• Loading States: Shows loading state during creation

### ✅ Better Auth Integration

• List Organizations: Uses authClient.useListOrganizations() composable
• Create Organization: Uses authClient.organization.create() method
• Check Slug: Uses authClient.organization.checkSlug() for validation
• Set Active: Uses authClient.organization.setActive() for switching organizations

### ✅ Table Features
• Organization Display: Shows logo (or fallback), name, and slug
• Member Count: Displays number of members with badge
• Creation Date: Formatted date display
• Actions Menu: Dropdown with options to view members, settings, and set as active

### ✅ Navigation Integration

• Menu Item: Added Organizations link to sidebar navigation
• Keyboard Shortcut: Added g-o shortcut for quick navigation
• Icon: Uses building icon for organizations

### ✅ Error Handling & UX

• Toast Notifications: Success/error messages for all actions
• Debounced Slug Check: Prevents excessive API calls
• Form Reset: Clears form after successful creation
• Disabled States: Properly disables buttons during operations

### ✅ Technical Implementation

• Type Safety: Proper TypeScript types for all data
• Component Resolution: Uses Nuxt UI components correctly
• Reactive Data: Proper Vue 3 reactivity patterns
• Build Success: Code compiles without errors

The organizations page is now fully functional and integrates seamlessly with the existing Better Auth setup and Nuxt UI design system. Users can:

1. View all their organizations in a clean table format
2. Create new organizations with validation
3. Set organizations as their active workspace
4. Navigate easily through the sidebar or keyboard shortcuts

The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns and maintains consistency with other pages like customers and settings.
