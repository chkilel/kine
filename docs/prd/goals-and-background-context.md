## Background Context

This PRD expands on the existing product brief to create a comprehensive multi-tenant physiotherapy practice management application. The solution addresses the challenge of small practices juggling disparate tools (spreadsheets, separate calendars, paper files) by providing a unified platform that centralizes patient records, scheduling, billing, and clinical documentation. The application will initially target the Moroccan market with French as the primary UI language, with future support for Arabic in patient-facing interfaces. The multi-tenant architecture will allow multiple clinics to operate independently within the same application instance while maintaining strict data isolation and security.
