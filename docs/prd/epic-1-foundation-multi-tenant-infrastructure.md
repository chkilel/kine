# Epic 1: Foundation & Multi-Tenant Infrastructure

**Goal**: Establish the foundational infrastructure for a secure, multi-tenant application with proper authentication, organization management, and core security measures. This epic delivers the essential framework that all subsequent functionality will build upon, ensuring data isolation between clinics and robust security compliance from day one.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup & Development Environment

As a development team,
I want a properly configured development environment with all necessary dependencies and tooling,
so that we can efficiently develop and test the application with consistent standards.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Node.js environment** with proper version management and dependency locking
2. **TypeScript configuration** with strict type checking and consistent compiler options
3. **ESLint and Prettier** setup with healthcare-specific linting rules
4. **Git hooks** for pre-commit checks and code quality enforcement
5. **Docker configuration** for local development and production deployment
6. **Documentation** for setup instructions and development workflow

## Story 1.2: Database Schema & Multi-Tenant Architecture

As a system architect,
I want a properly designed database schema with multi-tenant support and row-level security,
so that each clinic's data is completely isolated and secure from other organizations.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **PostgreSQL database** with proper schema design for multi-tenancy
2. **Row-level security policies** enforcing data isolation between organizations
3. **Drizzle ORM setup** with type-safe migrations and database interactions
4. **Organization model** with tenant isolation at the database level
5. **Audit logging** framework for tracking data access and modifications
6. **Backup and recovery** procedures documentation

## Story 1.3: Authentication & Authorization System

As a clinic administrator,
I want a secure authentication system with organization-based access control,
so that users can only access their own clinic's data with appropriate permissions.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **better-auth integration** with Organization and Admin plugins
2. **JWT-based authentication** with secure token management
3. **Role-based access control** with clinic-specific permissions
4. **Session management** with automatic logout on inactivity
5. **Password policies** enforcing strong authentication requirements
6. **Secure cookie handling** with proper HTTP-only and secure flags

## Story 1.4: Core API Framework & Security

As a developer,
I want a robust API framework with proper security middleware and validation,
so that all API endpoints are secure, validated, and properly documented.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **RESTful API design** with consistent endpoint patterns
2. **Zod validation** for all request and response payloads
3. **Rate limiting** and abuse protection mechanisms
4. **CORS configuration** for proper cross-origin requests
5. **API documentation** with OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
6. **Error handling** with consistent error responses and logging

## Story 1.5: Internationalization Foundation

As a global user,
I want the application to support multiple languages from the beginning,
so that we can easily add new language support without major refactoring.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Vue I18n integration** with proper plugin configuration
2. **French language pack** as the default UI language
3. **RTL support infrastructure** for future Arabic implementation
4. **Language switching mechanism** with persistence
5. **Locale-aware formatting** for dates, numbers, and currencies
6. **Translation management** system for future expansion
