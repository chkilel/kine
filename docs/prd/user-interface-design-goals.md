# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The application will follow a calendar-centric design philosophy where the calendar serves as the primary navigation hub. The interface will prioritize simplicity and efficiency for healthcare professionals, with progressive disclosure of complex clinical forms to reduce cognitive load.

- **Contextual Actions**: Actions are available in context (e.g., invoice generation from completed sessions)
- **Real-time Status Indicators**: Clear visual indicators for appointment status, payment status, and treatment progress
- **Multi-language Toggle**: Easy switching between French and Arabic interfaces with proper RTL support
