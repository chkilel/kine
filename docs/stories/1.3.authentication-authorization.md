# Story 1.3: Authentication & Authorization System

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** clinic administrator,
**I want** a secure authentication system with organization-based access control,
**so that** users can only access their own clinic's data with appropriate permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. better-auth integration with Organization and Admin plugins
2. JWT-based authentication with secure token management
3. Role-based access control with clinic-specific permissions
4. Session management with automatic logout on inactivity
5. Password policies enforcing strong authentication requirements
6. Secure cookie handling with proper HTTP-only and secure flags

## Dev Notes

- Recommended technologies documented in stack evaluation — see <mcfile name="technology-stack-evaluation.md" path="/Users/adil/Dev/01-Projects/02-kine/web-app/docs/architecture/technology-stack-evaluation.md"></mcfile>
- Validation library: Zod v4 is already a dependency — see <mcfile name="package.json" path="/Users/adil/Dev/01-Projects/02-kine/web-app/package.json"></mcfile>
- API routes live under `server/api` — confirm existing areas like `customers`, `mails`, `members`, `notifications` and align auth middleware accordingly — see <mcfile name="server/api" path="/Users/adil/Dev/01-Projects/02-kine/web-app/server/api"></mcfile>

### Testing

- Integration tests for auth flows using `@nuxt/test-utils` — see <mcfile name="testing-strategy.md" path="/Users/adil/Dev/01-Projects/02-kine/web-app/docs/implementation-guide/testing-strategy.md"></mcfile>
- Unit tests for RBAC helpers and token utilities
