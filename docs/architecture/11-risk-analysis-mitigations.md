# 11) Risk Analysis & Mitigations

Key Risks
- Auth integration complexity and edge cases with org scoping.
- Data model evolution causing migration churn.
- Scheduling conflict detection correctness.
- Billing accuracy and reconciliation.
- i18n/RTL regressions.

Mitigations
- Incremental rollout with feature flags; extensive integration tests.
- Migration discipline: semantic naming, test seeds, roll-forward strategies.
- Deterministic scheduling rules with unit tests; visual conflict indicators.
- Billing validation tests and double-entry checks where applicable.
- Accessibility/i18n testing and QA scenarios for core flows.
